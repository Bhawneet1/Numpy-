## Overview

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. This repository covers a wide range of NumPy concepts through:
- Explanatory code snippets and notebooks
- Two main mini projects (Sudoku Solver, Student Data Analysis)
- Practice exercises

## NumPy Concepts Covered

The following NumPy concepts are demonstrated in the included scripts and notebooks:

- **Array Creation**: np.array, np.zeros, np.ones, np.arange, np.linspace, np.eye, random arrays
- **Array Indexing and Slicing**: 1D, 2D, and 3D slicing, boolean indexing, fancy indexing
- **Array Operations**: Element-wise math, broadcasting, aggregation (sum, mean, std, etc.)
- **Reshaping and Manipulation**: reshape, flatten, transpose, concatenate, split, stack
- **Data Types**: dtype, type conversion
- **Iterating Over Arrays**: nditer, vectorization
- **Matrix Operations**: dot product, matrix multiplication, determinants, inverses
- **Statistical Methods**: min, max, median, percentile, argmin, argmax
- **Random Module**: np.random for simulation and testing
- **File I/O**: Saving and loading arrays with np.save, np.load, np.genfromtxt
- **Practical Applications**: Real-world usage in games and data analysis

## Projects

### Sudoku Solver

- **Description**: Solves Sudoku puzzles using NumPy arrays for board representation and logic.
- **NumPy Concepts Used**:
  - Board as a 2D NumPy array
  - Array indexing for constraint checking
  - Efficient masking and logical operations
- **How to Run**:
    ```bash
    python sudoku_solver.py
    ```
- **Features**:
  - Input puzzles via code or file
  - Displays solved board
  - Efficient backtracking with NumPy optimizations

### Student Data Analysis

- **Description**: Analyzes student performance data (such as scores, attendance, etc.) using NumPy.
- **NumPy Concepts Used**:
  - Loading data from files (csv, txt)
  - Array math for grade calculations
  - Statistical analysis (mean, median, std, etc.)
  - Filtering and masking for data selection
- **How to Run**:
    ```bash
    python student_data.py
    ```
- **Features**:
  - Calculates statistics for student groups
  - Finds top performers and trends
  - Can be extended with plotting (matplotlib)

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bhawneet1/Numpy-.git
cd Numpy-
pip install numpy
```
(Some projects may also require matplotlib or pandas.)

## Usage

Run any script directly with Python:

```bash
python <script_name.py>
```
Or explore the notebooks for interactive learning.
